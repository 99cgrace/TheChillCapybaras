    <h3>🎯 Pitch</h3>
    <p>Glow and Flow is a mental health app that implements fun and cute ways for people to improve their mental health. Imagine an app where you can interact with others for support, write your own thoughts, and plan out your studying time! This app is a 3-in-1 deal that all teens should take.</p>

    <h3>🌍 Theme Implementation</h3>
    <p>The app that we plan on designing is a mental health awareness and it is supposed to target teens specifically. Competitors like Headspace and apps like Finch and Calm have a similar branding and objectives which is to only benefit help those maintain a healthy mind. However, our app is teen specific and will be made to target that generation.</p>

    <h3>🧠 Why We Built This</h3>
    <p>As students ourselves, we know all too well the struggles of being teens. We all have our own problems, whether it's school wise or feeling pressure from social media. This app is something we know we would love to use ourselves.</p>
