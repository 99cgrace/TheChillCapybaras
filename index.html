    <h3>🎯 Pitch</h3>
    <p>Ever struggle with keeping a healthy schedule? What about academic pressure? Or maybe you just need someone to talk to? Look no further, "Glow and Flow" offers a 3-in-1 deal! This is the perfect app for teens!</p>

    <h3>🌍 Theme Implementation</h3>
    <p>The app that we plan on designing is a mental health awareness and it is supposed to target teens specifically. We work on studying schedules, planners, and check-ins
</p>

    <h3>🧠 Why We Built This</h3>
    <p>As students ourselves, we know all too well the struggle of being a teen. We all have problems whether they stem from schoolwork, mental illness, or something at home. Our app is designed in a way where we ourselves would use it and hope that others will too!</p>
